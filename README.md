🚀 This is a simple React Todo App built using React + Vite, inspired by the 📚 Thapa Technical YouTube tutorial. It allows users to 📝 add tasks through an input field and displays them in a clean, dynamic list. The app uses the ⚛ useState hook for state management and features a minimal, user-friendly UI styled with 🎨 basic CSS.
